#reasons why the beerdiertje is the superior animal

##some critics ( uche uche David) say the beerdiertje is a weak and useless animal,but this isn't true and here is why.

the beerdiertje is a superior animal because it can survive and withstand extreme conditions and environmental catastrophes,
and although the ant-loving David migt suggest otherwise,they won't get extinct because of predators,
as they get offspring so fast that the predators will not be able to eat them all
