# Why the tardigrade sucks

## The tardigrade has no potential for surviving anything else than Armageddon.

The tardigrade is a weak, low intelligance animal who does not not know how to defend itself properly against predators.
The things it can survive however are: extreme heat, extreme cold, meteor strikes, nuclear radiation, and so on. 
Is this really what an animal needs to survive? Resistance to extinxtion level events and nothing else?
I think not.
